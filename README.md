ByteCave Image Server, (c) 2019-2020 ByteCave. Usage under the MIT License.

ByteCave Image Server is an open-source mini webserver that sends a random image to your browser when a client sends any GET request. You provide a recursively processed folder containing the images to display. Those images are then shuffled and never repeated--on a per client connection basis--until all images have been displayed once. The process then repeats itself for subsequent image requests.
